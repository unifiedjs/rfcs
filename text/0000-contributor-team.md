# Summary

It'd be nice to add a “contributor” team to unified organizations which
all contributors are invited to.
There’s precedent here with what Gatsby does and helps contributors
receive a warm welcome to the community after getting a PR merged.

## Basic example

If a user gets a PR merged they receive an invite to the org as a “contributor”.
The contributor team has triage (not write) access on GitHub.

## Motivation

To make contributors feel welcome.

## Detailed design

*   [Motion to nominate a contributor][motion]
*   [`github-tools`][tools]

## Drawbacks

*   Could grow into 100s of inactive contributors

## Alternatives

*   GitHub contribution graph
*   [`all-contributors`][all-contributors]
