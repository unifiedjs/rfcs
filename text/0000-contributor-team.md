# Summary

It'd be nice to add a "contributor" team to unified organizations which
all contributors are invited to. There's precedent here with what Gatsby
does and helps contributors receive a warm welcome to the community after
getting a PR merged.

## Basic example

If a user gets a PR merged they receive an invite to the org as a "contributor".
The contributor team doesn't have write access.

## Motivation

To make contributors feel welcome.

## Detailed design

For now we can manually handle it, but eventually we can use a GitHub Action.

## Drawbacks

None that I can see.
